\begin{abstract}
As the complexity of home networks increases, it is inevitable that they will
require splitting into multiple subnets. As the average home user lacks the
knowledge required to configure a router, a minimal configuration solution is
required. In this project enhancements have been to an existing implementation
of the Open Shortest Path First for IPv6 (OSPFv3) routing protocol, Quagga.
This augmented daemon requires no configuration to run, and handles the
allocation of IPv6 prefixes to the subnets in the home network. The
implementation is based mainly on two highly topical internet drafts published
recently by the IETF\@\nomenclature{IETF}{Internet Engineering Task Force}, and
demonstrates interoperability with other existing implementations. As an
extension, a proof-of-concept was produced to show how source based routing
could be used to overcome issues with multihomed networks.

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank the following people for all their help, support and
influence during this project. Firstly, Tim Chown who offered a huge amount of
support as my project supervisor. Jari Arkko and Acee Lindem who wrote the
internet drafts that made this project possible. I would also like to thank
Markus Stenberg and Benjamin Paterson for providing implementations against
which to run interoperability tests. David Lamparter, and all the other
maintainers of the Quagga project, who responded to many of my queries about
how Quagga works. And finally my friends and family who kindly proof read this
document.
