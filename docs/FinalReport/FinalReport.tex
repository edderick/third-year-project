\begin{abstract}
As home networks become more and more complex, it is inevitable that they will
require splitting into multiple subnets. As the average home user is unable to
configure a router, a minimal configuration solution is required. In this
project I produced an implementation zero configuration OSPF based on drafts
published by the IETF. 
\end{abstract}

\chapter{Acknowledgements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tim Chown - Offered support as project supervisor
\item David Lamparter - Responded to my queries about how Quagga works
\item Jari Arkko - Wrote the drafts that I was implementing

\item Markus Stenberg \& Benjamin Paterson - Provided implementations against which to interop test
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Introduction}
A clear statement of the problem and goals of the project.

Start with a general overview of home networking. Futuristic network schpiel.

\section{IPV6}
Whole section on this? Definitely needs to be a heading somewhere!

\begin{itemize}
\item IPv4 Address space exhaustion
\item Bag of sand - address each robot with IPV6?
\item Always hand out a /64 to a network.
\end{itemize}

\section{Routing}
Explain what routing is

\begin{itemize}
\item Links state - OSPF: each router knows whole topology
\item Distance Vector - RIP): each router advertises how far away destinations are
\item Really want to mention BATMAN. ;)
\end{itemize}

\section{Present}
\subsection{Home}
Talk about what networks are like in the home at the moment.
\begin{itemize} 
\item Single ISP
\item IPV4
\item NAT 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Campus and Enterprise}
Talk about larger networks and how they already exploit more advance features.

Also explain how they require full time systems administrators to configure them!

Note that ECS has IPV6 (Dual stack)

\section{Future}
\begin{itemize}
\item Multiple subnets. 
\item Homenet WG? Finding solutions to the above problem

/* Don't directly mention drafts, just problems they solve. */

\item autoconf - The main draft, Router IDs \& and extensible platform for adding more autoconf stuff to.
\item prefix delegation - The bulk of the work!
\end{itemize}

\section{Goals}
Good software shouldn't be visible to it's users

==$>$ Just plug the devices in and it's good to go. 

==Emphasise bleeding edge?==

\chapter{Literature Review} 
A review of the \textbf{background} literature

=$>$ Could go on forever. Need to be consice. 

---$>$ Probably want to talk about other stuff

Required In depth discussion:
\begin{itemize}
\item Draft IETF autoconf 
\item Draft Jarri PD
\end{itemize}

Worthy of an honorable mention:

\begin{itemize}
\item draft-CHOWN - Puts forward a vision of future home networking
\item RFC2328 - OSPFv2 - Studied in depth to understand how the ospf Protocol works. Lot of stuff about Areas that I don't need\ldots
\item RFC5340 - OSPFv3 - Studied in depth. Explains the diference between an OSPFv3 implementation and and OSPFv2.
\item draft-dimitri-zOSPF - An old draft that had similar aims.
\item RFC5329 - OSPFv3-TE - Allows network wide QoS type stuff. Not sure why interesting anymore :p
\item RFC5250 - Opaque LSAs - A generic type of LSA. 
\end{itemize}

Books:

\begin{itemize}
\item Good for getting a general overview
\item Clarify things from the RFCs 
\item THEY DON'T COVER ANY OF THE NEW STUFF COZ IT'S BLEEDIN' EDGE!!one
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Analysis}
An analysis and specification of the solution to the problem

\section{Alternatives}
Chat about possible alternatives to this solution

\subsection{DHCP-PD}
Main realistic alternative

Issue of hierachical delegation (Inefficient use of address space)

--Stateless \& Statefull + SLAAC?

\subsection{Manual Configuration?}
Possible, but users won't find it all that easy!

\section{How OSPF works}
Show that I understand fully how OSPF works. 

--$>$ Mention v2 \& v3

Details of the core LSA types. Mention the other LSAs

- Network, Router 

- Top->Area->Interface

\section{Implementation Candidates}
=== Does a comparison of the routing daemons go in here?

\subsection{Bird}
Lighterweight. C. Talk about Ben and Markus's implementations.

\subsection{Quagga}
Fairly heavy weight, extensible, C, No implementation. Very active project

\subsection{XORP}
XORP => Heaviest weight C++ No implementation. A dying project.

\section{Chosen Implementation}
Why did I chose quagga?

\begin{itemize}
\item Mailing list
\item Separation of v2 and v3
\item No existing implementation =$>$ more useful to the community
\end{itemize}

= A hand wavy explanation?

\chapter{Design}
A detailed design

= Discuss How it actually all works?

--$>$ Only one area!

\section{New LSA Type}
To do what we gotta do, we add the LSA type Auto Configuration LSA. 

Diagram time (Use a simple ASCII diagram maybe?)

\subsection{TLVs}

Type-Length-Values the payload of the AC LSA. 

Extensible

\subsubsection{Router-Hardware-Fingerprint TLV}

Explain what the TLV contains. No need to talk about how it is generated.

\subsubsection{Aggregated Prefix TLV}

Shorter than /64 

Assignments made from it

\subsubsection{Assigned Prefix TLV}

Exactly /64 

Assigned to an interface

\chapter{Implementation}
The implementation

+ How I actually did the dirty

\section{Core algorithms?}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Router Hardware Fingerprint Generation
  \item Router ID Conflict Resolution
  \item Prefix Assignment
  \item Prefix Conflict Resolution
  \item ULA Generation
\end{itemize} 

*Talk about the style of Quagga's code?
Cite the Hacking Guide and the GNU coding standards.

- The issues that I found
    Little Endian vs Big Endian
    
-Chat about C?

= I would like to have something about C

\begin{itemize}
  \item Structs
  \item MEMORY LEAKS?
  \item Lack of Objects - How do you write clean code without objects
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Testing}
Testing strategy and results

Should I put about the tunnel broker in here?

\section{Netkit} 
Made testing fresh and easy. 

REALLY LET TIM KNOW HOW GOOD IT IS!

Stick a screen shot in the appendix :)

\section{Tunnel Broker}
Should I talk about how I configured it all to work with a tunnel broker here?

\section{Alix2d3}
Bit harder, but still did it anyway.

\section{Interoperability}

Tested against other existing implementations.

Assertions -$>$ IF I actually put some in my code\ldots

\textbf{DO I NEED UNIT TESTS?}

\chapter{Project Management}
/* Might be able to sneak this bit into the Appendix */

\section{Gantt Charts}
The most exciting part of this document!

\section{Tools}
With a project like this, there must be lots of tools used. 

\subsection{Git}
You need a version control system!

GitHub is really good. And I'm pretty sure they put a lot of effort into backup.

\subsection{Trello}
Gotta love that task management system

\section{Risk Assesment}
Asses that risk; Like a Boss

\chapter{Evaluation}
A critical evaluation

\section{What Went Well?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Wrote loads of C
\item Ended up with something that seems to work.
\end{itemize}

\section{What Could Have Gone Better?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Not much really :p
\item Could have spoken more to Jarri
\item More feedback from community??
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Conclusions And Future Work}
Conclusions and future work

\section{Conclusions}

It is possible to do

Some things aren't very prescriptive in the draft

\begin{itemize}
\item It works! 
\item Release source code to community
\item Code reviews
\item Attend IETF 87
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
Some things I have thought about, but haven't actually done yet.

\section{DHCP6-PD}
Would be nice to have quagga intercept DHCP6-PD messages and use the prefixes as aggregated prefixes. 

At the moment I didn't manage to do this and I it was deemed beyond project scope.

\section{Source Based Routing}
I might actually create a branch of my code to do a quick proof of concept. At the moment, 
it would be beyond the scope of the project to implement this. 

\section{Multi-hop Service discovery}
I think that this would be worthy of a third year project on it's own. 
Too little standardization - Really something apple would need to contribute to. 

== I DO WANT TO HAVE A GO AT DOING SERVICE DISCOVERY.
-- There is a possibility I will be able to get an RFC out of it :D :D :D

\section{Realization}
It would be nice to see this kind of system deployed in the home. 
Requires ISPs to start using IPv6.
Outside my control. 
Note: Andrews and Arnold.

=>Things beyond my controls - IPV6 etc
