IPV6 Tunnel Brokers
===================

Hurricane electric seems to be the most popular IPV6 Tunnel Broker. 

They offer both /64 tunnels and /48 tunnels if that is what you require.

When setting up a tunnel, one can pretty much just use their settings. Heed
their warnign though, where they have put your public IPV4 address, you should
really replace that with a private address. I don't know if the settings that I
always do in the router are actually needed... 


*NOTE*: Don't forget to turn on IPV6 forwarding on all the devices that will be
acting as routers!!!
