Hello Everyone, 

First of all, let me introduce myself. I am Edward Seabrook, I am a third year
undergraduate studying Computer Science at the University of Southampton. For
my third year project I shall be extending Quagga's ospf6d to implement
auto-configuration OSPFv3. I felt I should let the community know, and see if 
anyone has any advice.

The changes that I plan on making are based on a draft standard[1] published by
Ericsson. The draft also depends on some other drafts that may or may not
require implementing as well. If anyone has any reasons they feel these changes
would be impossible with Quagga, please let me know!

I would like my work to be as useful as possible to the community, as such I
aim on complying with the standards that the project follows. I have read the
GNU coding standards document as recommended in the Quagga Hacking guide. If
anyone has any other tips or caveats I would love to hear them.

Currently I shall be storing my code in a fork of Guagga on GitHub. If there is
a preferred way of doing this I will be more that happy to switch to it. I have
forked the latest release and plan on sticking with this release for the
duration of the project - I have read that ospf6d is undergoing some
fundamental changes, depending on the scale of these changes I may be able to
apply my changes to the new code. 

As a final note, I am new to mailing lists, so please excuse me if I have done
anything wrong here!

Thanks, 
Edward Seabrook
