# Edward Seabrook's Third Year Project

This repository contains the work submitted for the individual project in
the third year of my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at the University
of Southampton. 

This documentation may be useful for understanding the implementation of
Zeroconfig OSPF that I produced during the project.
